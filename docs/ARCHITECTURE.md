## Fitness Tracker MVP: Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architectural design of the Fitness Tracker MVP, a web application that empowers users to achieve their fitness goals through goal setting, progress tracking, and a supportive community.

### 1. Layered Architecture

The Fitness Tracker MVP follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers for improved modularity, maintainability, and scalability:

- **Presentation Layer:**  The presentation layer is responsible for rendering the user interface (UI), handling user interactions, and displaying data to the user. It leverages Next.js and React for efficient UI management, incorporating Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and UI components for reusable elements.

- **Application Layer:**  The application layer orchestrates the execution of use cases, coordinates interactions with services, and acts as an intermediary between the presentation and domain layers. It handles data transformations and manages communication between different components.

- **Domain Layer:**  The domain layer encapsulates the core business logic of the application, defining entities like Goal, User, and ProgressEntry, and implementing business rules and validation logic for these entities.

- **Infrastructure Layer:**  The infrastructure layer handles interactions with external systems, including data persistence (PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM), API calls for authentication and other services (NextAuth.js, Google API, etc.), logging, and error handling.

### 2. Component Interactions

The components of the application interact through a well-defined flow:

- **User Interactions:**  Users interact with UI elements (buttons, forms, etc.) in the presentation layer, triggering events or API calls.
- **Presentation to Application:**  The presentation layer communicates with the application layer through events, state updates, or API requests.
- **Application to Domain:**  The application layer passes data and requests to the domain layer to execute business logic.
- **Domain to Infrastructure:**  The domain layer interacts with the infrastructure layer for data persistence, API calls, and external system interactions.
- **Infrastructure to Domain:**  The infrastructure layer returns data from the database or API calls to the domain layer.
- **Domain to Application:**  The domain layer sends results of business logic execution to the application layer.
- **Application to Presentation:**  The application layer sends updated data to the presentation layer, triggering UI updates.

### 3. State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management, providing a simple and efficient way to handle data across components.

- **Global State:**  The Zustand store acts as a global store for application-wide data, accessible by any component using the `useStore()` hook.
- **Local State:**  Components also manage their own local state using React's `useState` hooks for specific UI elements and interactions.
- **State Updates:**  The Zustand store can be updated using `set` methods provided by the library, ensuring consistent state changes across the application.
- **Data Flow:**  State updates in the Zustand store trigger re-renders of components that depend on the updated state.

### 4. API Interactions

The frontend interacts with the backend API through well-defined RESTful endpoints:

- **`/api/goals`**:  Handles operations related to goals, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- **`/api/auth/register`**:  Handles user registration.
- **`/api/auth/login`**:  Handles user login.
- **`/api/community`**:  Handles operations related to community posts, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- **`/api/users/:userId`**:  Handles user profile management, including retrieval and updating.

- **Data Formats:** The API utilizes JSON for data exchange.
- **Authentication:** All protected API endpoints require a JWT authentication token included in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer TOKEN`.

### 5. Database Integration

The application leverages PostgreSQL as the primary database, managed through Supabase for efficient setup and scaling. Prisma ORM simplifies database interactions.

- **Schema:** The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` and includes tables for `User` and `Goal` entities.
- **Data Storage:** Data is stored and retrieved from the database using Prisma client methods.
- **Data Consistency:** Prisma's validation and constraints help maintain data consistency and integrity.

### 6. Authentication and Authorization

The application uses NextAuth.js with multi-provider support for user authentication and authorization.

- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js handles authentication with Google and Email/Password providers, offering a seamless login experience.
- **Authorization:**  Users are granted specific permissions based on their roles or access levels, enforced using JWT tokens and session management.

### 7. Error Handling

The application implements robust error handling to ensure resilience and graceful degradation:

- **Error Types:**  Errors can occur during API calls, database interactions, authentication, UI rendering, or other unexpected situations.
- **Error Capture:**  Errors are caught using `try/catch` blocks in the appropriate components or services.
- **Error Logging:**  All errors are logged using Sentry for centralized error tracking and reporting.
- **UI Feedback:**  Error messages are displayed to the user in the UI to provide clear feedback and guidance.

### 8. Deployment Strategy

The Fitness Tracker MVP leverages Docker for containerization and Vercel for hosting and deployment:

- **Docker:** The application is packaged as a Docker container to ensure consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments.
- **Vercel:** Vercel provides a platform for easy deployment and scaling, managing serverless functions, and handling static asset hosting.
- **Deployment Process:** The deployment process involves building a Docker image, pushing it to a container registry, and deploying the container to Vercel using its CI/CD pipeline.

### 9. Key Design Decisions and Considerations

- **Technology Choices:** 
    - **Next.js:** Chosen for its ease of use, server-side rendering capabilities, and built-in routing system.
    - **React:** Selected for its component-based architecture and powerful UI development capabilities.
    - **Tailwind CSS:**  Adopted for its utility-first approach, providing fast styling and responsiveness.
    - **PostgreSQL with Supabase:**  Selected for its scalability, reliability, and ease of setup.
    - **Zustand:**  Chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of integration with React.
    - **NextAuth.js:**  Chosen for its seamless authentication integration and multi-provider support.
    - **Sentry:**  Selected for its powerful error tracking and reporting capabilities.
- **Trade-offs:**
    - **Scalability vs. Initial Development Speed:**  The decision to use a managed database service like Supabase prioritizes scalability and ease of setup, potentially sacrificing some flexibility compared to self-hosted solutions.
    - **Simple UI vs. Advanced UX:**  The MVP focuses on essential UI elements for rapid development, potentially sacrificing some design features or customizability for future enhancements.
- **Architectural Constraints:**
    -  Limited features:  The MVP focuses on core features, deferring more complex functionalities to future iterations. 
    -  Limited database interactions: The database schema is currently limited to essential user and goal information.

### 10. Future Considerations

- **Scalability:**  As the application scales, it may be necessary to consider database sharding, load balancing, and distributed caching strategies.
- **Feature Expansion:** Future features like workout plans, personalized recommendations, community groups, and gamification elements can be easily integrated into the existing architecture. 
- **Technology Updates:**   The architecture should be designed to accommodate the latest versions of libraries and frameworks to ensure continued performance and security.

### Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Fitness Tracker MVP's architecture, highlighting its layered structure, component interactions, data management, and deployment strategies. By adhering to these design principles and utilizing a robust technology stack, the Fitness Tracker MVP is well-positioned to deliver a successful and scalable fitness platform for users, paving the way for future expansion and innovation.
